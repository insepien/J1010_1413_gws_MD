# J1010_1413_gws

This repository contains two jupyter notebooks that reproduce the figures in [Goulding+ 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03757). 

## timscales_plot.ipynb
This makes Fig. 3 in the paper, which shows the timescales for J1010+1413 as a function of semi-major axis.

## gwb_calculation.ipynb
This makes Fig. 5 in the paper, which shows our number density assumptions and final GWB amplitude calculations.

Feel free to use these notebooks to calculate timescales or limits for your favorite object! If you have any questions or comments on this code, email me at: kpardo @ astro . princeton . edu.
